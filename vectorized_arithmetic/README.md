## 🧪 Project 2: Sensor Signal Processing
In this project, I moved beyond simple slicing to **Vectorized 
Arithmetic**. 

### Skills Demonstrated:
- **Scalar Operations:** Boosting raw data by a factor of 2.
- **Universal Functions (ufuncs):** Using `np.sqrt()` for efficient data 
smoothing.
- **Element-wise Arithmetic:** Subtracting noise arrays from signal 
arrays.
- **Boolean Masking:** Creating an "Alert" system using comparison 
operators (`> 3.0`).

This demonstrates how NumPy handles complex math pipelines without using 
slow Python loops.
